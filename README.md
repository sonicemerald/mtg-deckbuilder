===============

(WIP) Magic the Gathering card viewer / deck builder created for CS 360 - Object Oriented Programming - Fall 2013

For the final project of CS360, we were required to create a android app that utilized fragemnets, pulling data from a JSON file,
and OOP paradigms.

The goal of the app is to have a easy to use deck-building app for Magic the Gathering.
Currently, the deck-building aspect of the app is lacking, 
but you can view cards from each set, and add them to a list.

This is an old project: Updated version (for Lollipop!) will be on github soon.
